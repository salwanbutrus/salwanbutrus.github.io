Hey there, welcome to my personal website! I received my PhD Candidate from UC Berkeley in [Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering](https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/cbe) and the [Center for Computational Biology](https://ccb.berkeley.edu/). I applied machine learning to high-dimensional genomics datasets to study brain development in Karthik Shekhar's [group](https://www.shekharlab.net/). Currently, I'm a Computational Biologist at Curve Biosciences. At Curve, we adopt a hybrid biology/data-driven approach to develop blood tests that will guide patients with chronic disease on their decades-long journeys. I'm passionate about education, mentorship, interdisciplinary research, and sports. Click around to see what I've been up to at work and beyond.
