### **Nanomechanical properties of zwitterionic polymer brushes**


I began this project because I was intrigued by interfacial phenomena, namely those governing the performance of polymer brush coatings in supporting exogenous donor-free culture of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Prior work had indicated that surface rigidity and elasticity influence cell attachment, spreading, proliferation, and differentiation, but no studies had directly investigated the interaction between thickness, wettability, and nanomechanical properties of the surfaces developed by our group. I probed 1) whether simple reaction parameters that govern thickness and wettability can modulate the nanomechanical properties of these synthetic surfaces and 2) whether hESC propagation responded to these variations in architectural regimes.

Through a statistical design of experiments approach, I employed chemical vapor deposition and atom transfer radical polymerization to design polymer brush coatings of varying thicknesses and wettabilities then acquired their reduced Youngâ€™s modulus ($E_r$) and hardness (H) via nanoindentation. Analysis of variance for Er and H suggested that the nanomechanical properties are shaped by a complex interplay between thickness and wettability. This work explained previous results2 from our group, where cells preferred the moderately thick and moderately hydrophobic coatings because they had the optimal $$ E_r $$ and H for rapid hESC propagation.
