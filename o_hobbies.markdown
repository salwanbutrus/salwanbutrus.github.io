# **Hobbies**

When I'm not working, you'll find me either playing or watching sports. Here's a selection of some of the teams I've had the pleasure of being on during graduate school. Not pictured are our CBE basketball and soccer teams.

Grad school has unearthed an outdoorsy side of me that I didn't know existed. You can follow my adventures on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/101349112).

My favorite sport to watch is by far Formula 1. I haven't gone to a live race yet, but here's a video of me freaking out at the sight of racing cars for the first time at Laguna Seca Raceway in May 2021.
