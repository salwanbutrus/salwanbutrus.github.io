# **Hobbies**

When I'm not working, you'll find me either playing or watching sports. Here's a selection of some of the teams I've had the pleasure of being on during graduate school. Not pictured are our CBE basketball and soccer teams.

Over the last year I've gotten into camping/hiking and caught a major case of the skiing bug.

My favorite sport to watch is by far Formula 1. I haven't gone to a live race yet, but here's a video of me freaking out at the sight of racing cars for the first time at Laguna Seca Raceway in May 2021.
